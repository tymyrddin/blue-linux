# Turning devices on and off

Depending on your location, you may want to turn devices off and on. Some devices can be turned on and off by software, and some by blacklisting. Kernel modules are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. And modules can be blacklisted. 

For basic commands for kernel modules, see the section [kernel modules](https://tymyrddin.wiki/linux/kernel#kernel_modules) in the Kinky linux command-line.

# Malware removal

The [detection steps](Malware-detection.md) minimally prepare you for receiving optimal help on forums and mailing lists, and at best give you clues you need for further research on what to remove where: Did you find indications of a trojan or backdoor? Or a virus or worm?

## If all else fails

* If a VM was infected, revert back to an earlier snapshot that you think was clean or import an earlier exported ova of it. This will probably not help if the host was reached, of course.
* A non-VM machine can be reinstalled. To make this experience an enjoyable event if and when it happens, have regular backups of data, and that personal information on an external disk and still totally clean. We laugh in the face of cooties and their masters!

It is possible for malware to persist across a re-format and re-install, if it is sufficiently ingenious and sophisticated: if for example, it can persist in the BIOS, in the firmware for peripherals (some hardware devices have firmware that can be updated, and thus could be updated with malicious firmware), or with a virus infecting data files on removable storage or on your backups. 

However, *most* malware doesn't do anything quite this nasty. Therefore, while there are no guarantees, re-formatting and re-installing should get rid of almost all malware you're likely to encounter in the wild. 

But, not all. Targeted surveillance and spy vs spy games is another game entirely.

# Introduction

Every computer connected to the internet is participating in that network and has the ability to receive malicious 
files. It costs nothing, literally, to run antivirus on Linux, so it is a mystery to me why some people feel that not 
using Linux antivirus is worth the risk. There is ample evidence of Linux malware in existence.

Indicators of compromise:

* Machine is running slower than usual
* Machine is consuming more power than necessary
* Strange behaviour, such as installing programs without your consent, even after rebooting it.

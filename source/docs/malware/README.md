# Introduction

Wait, Linux needs antivirus and anti-malware solutions? I thought it was immune to such things??? And with that, it is an [attractive target](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/linux-targeted-malware-increased-by-35-percent-in-2021/). 

Indicators of compromise:

* Machine is running slower than usual
* Machine is consuming more power than necessary
* Strange behaviour, such as installing programs without your consent, even after rebooting it.

Find these, think you have an infected system, or just wish to know more, [find malware and clean the machine](clean-machine.md).

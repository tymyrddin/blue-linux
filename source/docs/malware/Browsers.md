# Browsers

Many of the browser vulnerabilities exploited by the attacks and abuses mentioned need to be fixed by the developers of browsers and web applications, which arenâ€™t much under the direct control of users, but users are not entirely powerless.

* View the metadata browsers are sending
* Check extensions/add-ons/plugins for known vulnerabilities
* Change default browser settings to [exclude cookies](https://tymyrddin.github.io/data-mitigations/docs/browsing/Cookies.html) and [FLoC](https://tymyrddin.github.io/data-mitigations/docs/browsing/FLoC.html), since they can be used to build up detailed profiles of surfing patterns over time.
* Use private browsing.
* Use the rest of [safer browsing](https://tymyrddin.github.io/data-mitigations/docs/browsing/README.html) also.
* Use [networked or single-point anonymisers](https://tymyrddin.github.io/data-mitigations/docs/traffic/README.html) to obscure identifying information.
* Security awareness training
* Lock down the browser and the software it can invoke.
* Tighten associated application settings to disable unwanted features and to configure trust zones.

# Introduction

## Turning devices on and off

Depending on your location and context, you may want to turn devices, such as [webcam](camera-webcam.md) and 
[microphone](microphone.md) off and on. Some devices can be turned on and off 
by software, and some by blacklisting. Kernel modules are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel 
upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. 
And modules can be blacklisted. 

For basic commands for kernel modules, see [kernel modules](cheatsheets:docs/linux/kernel-modules) in the Kinky linux command-line.

## Restrict services

All linux distros let you control the services that run on your Linux installation, and you can make full use of this 
customisation feature to enhance security. You can, for example, [restrict access to cron](restrict-access-to-cron.md) 
and [disble applications via startup applications](startup-applications.md)

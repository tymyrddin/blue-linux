# Disabling via startup applications

For example, do you really need Samba for sharing files over the network, or the Bluetooth service to connect to 
Bluetooth devices on a computer that doesn't have a Bluetooth adapter? 

Go to //System -> Preferences -> Startup Applications// (Debian and its derivatives). Here you can remove check marks 
next to the services you wish to disable at startup. But be careful when turning off services. Some applications might 
stop functioning because they depend on a disabled service.

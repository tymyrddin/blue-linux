# Disable startup applications

For example, do you really need Samba for sharing files over the network, or the Bluetooth service to connect to 
Bluetooth devices on a computer that doesn't have a Bluetooth adapter? 

## Gnome

* Go to Show applications -> Startup Applications
* Remove check marks next to the services you wish to disable at startup. 

## Mate

In MATE, you can configure your startup applications in the main control centre, using the "Startup Applications" applet.

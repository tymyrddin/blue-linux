# Choose a secure browser that protects your privacy

* [Falkon](https://www.falkon.org/download/) uses QtWebEngine as its rendering engine, which is open-source. Falkon is primarily developed and maintained by the KDE community. QtWebEngine does use upstream code from the Chromium project, but removes binaries and Google-related services. 
* [Mullvad browser](https://mullvad.net/en/download/browser/linux) is the Tor browser without the Tor Network and instead of using the Tor Network, is designed to be used with a trustworthy virtual private network (VPN). Similar to the Tor browser, the Mullvad browser provides solid tracking and fingerprinting protection. Mullvad browser removes all telemetry and enables private browsing by default. uBlock Origin comes pre-installed as the default ad/tracker blocker.
* [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/) has no idea who you are or what sites you visit. 
* [Brave](https://brave.com/) is fast, secure, and privacy-focused by default. It has a built-in ad blocker and browser fingerprinting 
protection, while also giving you access to numerous add-ons and extensions.
* [Ungoogled Chromium browser](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium) is an open source project to provide a Chromium browser, without the Google privacy issues.
* [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/) is a fork of Firefox focused on privacy, security, and freedom, only available for desktop operating systems.
* [Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/) enables you to use Tor without needing to install the [Tor proxy](tor-proxy.md).

If the browser you choose is not secure and privacy-friendly, lock down the browser and the software it can invoke.
